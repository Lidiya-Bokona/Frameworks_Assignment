# ðŸ“Š Frameworks_Assignment â€” CORD-19 Data Explorer

## Overview
This project analyzes the **CORD-19 metadata** dataset using Python frameworks. It demonstrates a basic data science workflow: loading, cleaning, exploring, visualizing, and building a simple Streamlit app.

## Tools
- Python 3.7+
- pandas (data manipulation)
- matplotlib & seaborn (visualization)
- Streamlit (interactive app)
- Jupyter Notebook (exploration)

## Features
- 	Data cleaning (missing values, date parsing, word counts)
- 	Publication trends by year
-   Top publishing journals
-   Frequent title keywords
-   Interactive dashboard with filters

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo and create a virtual environment.
2. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. 	Place  inside the  folder.
4. 	Run the notebook for exploration:
    ```bash
     jupyter notebook Frameworks_Assignment.ipynb
5. 	Launch the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
      streamlit run app/app.py

## Reflection
This assignment strengthened skills in data wrangling, visualization, and framework integration. The main challenge was handling the large dataset, solved by sampling and cleaning for efficient analysis.
